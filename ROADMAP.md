# Roadmap for NHL Live Game Tracker and Analytics Dashboard

Detailed Plan for NHL Live Game Tracker and Analytics Dashboard

## Phase 1: Planning and Setup

### Week 1: Research and Environment Setup

#### 1. API Exploration

- Read and understand the NHL API documentation.
- Identify endpoints for live games, team stats, player stats, and historical data.
- Note rate limits and authentication requirements.

#### 2. Schema Design

- Define database schemas for
  - Live game events (game ID, timestamp, teams, scores, etc.).
  - Team statistics (team ID, wins, losses, goals, penalties, etc.).
  - Player statistics (player ID, goals, assists, penalties, etc.).
  - Historical analytics (trends, averages, etc.).

#### 3. Tech Stack Finalization

- Backend: Python FastAPI or Node.js.
- Frontend: React or Next.js with Material UI.
- Database:
  - Postgres for relational data.
  - Vector database (Weaviate, Milvus, or Vespa).
- Deployment: Docker for containerization and Vercel for frontend hosting.

#### 4. Development Environment Setup

- Initialize Git repositories for backend and frontend.
- Configure Docker for local development.
- Install necessary dependencies (e.g., GraphQL server, database clients).

## Phase 2: Core Feature Development

### Week 2: Live Game Tracking

#### 1. Backend Development

- Create a data fetcher to periodically query the NHL API for live game updates.
- Store live data in Postgres with a schema optimized for real-time queries.
- Set up WebSocket communication to push updates to the frontend.

#### 2. Frontend Development

- Build a live game dashboard to display scores, events, and player actions.
- Use Material UI components for a sleek and responsive design.

#### 3. Testing

- Simulate live game scenarios to test data flow from API to frontend.

### Week 3: Player and Team Statistics

#### 1. Backend Development

- Fetch team and player data from the NHL API.
- Store stats in Postgres, ensuring indexes for fast queries.

- Expose team and player data via GraphQL endpoints.

#### 2. Frontend Development

- Create team and player profile pages.
- Display stats in tables and charts for easy comparison.

#### 3. Testing

- Verify the accuracy of fetched and displayed stats.

### Week 4: Historical Trends and Analytics

#### 1. Backend Development

- Build aggregation queries to analyze historical data.
- Integrate a vector database for advanced similarity searches.

- Expose analytics data through GraphQL endpoints.

#### 2. Frontend Development

- Design visualizations for historical trends (e.g., line charts for performance over time).
- Add filters for custom date ranges and specific metrics.

##### 3. Testing

- Validate the correctness of aggregated analytics and visualizations.

### Week 5: Predictive Insights

#### 1. ML Model Development

- Train a basic predictive model using historical data (e.g., logistic regression for win probability).
- Use Python libraries like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow.
- Integrate the model with the backend for real-time predictions.

#### 2. Frontend Development

- Display predictions alongside live game stats and historical trends.

#### 3. Testing

- Compare model predictions with actual outcomes to measure accuracy.

### Week 6: Testing and Optimization

#### 1. End-to-End Testing

- Test data fetching, storage, API performance, and UI responsiveness.

#### 2. Optimization

- Optimize database queries and API endpoints for low latency.
- Implement caching with Redis for frequently accessed data.

#### 3. Documentation

- Document APIs, data schemas, and deployment steps.

## Phase 3: Advanced Feature Development

### Week 7: Custom Reports

#### 1. Backend Development

- Implement functionality to generate custom reports based on user-selected data (e.g., favorite teams or players).
- Use PDF generation libraries like PDFKit or Puppeteer.

#### 2. Frontend Development

- Add UI for report customization (e.g., filters for teams, players, date ranges).
- Include a "Generate Report" button.

#### 3. Testing

- Ensure reports are accurate and formatted correctly for download.

### Week 8: Final Testing and Deployment

#### 4. Testing

- Conduct comprehensive testing of all features and integrations.

#### 5. Deployment

- Deploy backend and database using Docker.
- Host frontend on Vercel.

#### 6. Launch

- Announce the project and gather feedback for future improvements.

## Phase 4: Post-Launch Enhancements

- Collect user feedback for further refinement.
- Plan additional features like advanced filtering options and notifications.
- Monitor system performance and scalability.
